                    <p>It all started with the basics.  HTML and CSS, Web design, Responsiveness, 
                    Optimizing and launching a site where all subjects covered in this course. 
                    Some of the knowledge and tips gained from it was used on this site.

                    <p>Now it was time to get technical and improve those problem-solving skills. 
                    How it works, DOM manipulation, Objects, Functions and ES6/ES2015. 
                    This course proved to be the most difficult yet most worthwhile and opens my career to more than just front-end development.
